Role Values Dataset
# Introduction of RVD
To evaluate the closeness of values expressed during LLMs’ role-playing and the roles themselves, we constructed a Role Values Dataset (RVD). The RVD encompasses 25 well-known roles, each with unique value orientations, drawn from China's Four Great Classical Novels Journey to the West, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, and Water Margin. Specifically, from Journey to the West, we chose four roles: Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Sha Wujing, and Tang Sanzang. From Romance of the Three Kingdoms, 12 roles were selected: Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhuge Liang, Liu Shan, Cao Cao, Yuan Shao, Sima Yi, Zhou Yu, Sun Quan, Dong Zhuo, and Lv Bu. In Dream of the Red Chamber, we identified eight roles: Jia Baoyu, Grandmother Jia, Lin Daiyu, Wang Xifeng, Xue Baochai, Shi Xiangyun, Hua Xiren, and Miaoyu. From Water Margin, we included Lu Zhishen. The rationale behind choosing these particular roles was to exemplify extremes within various value dimensions. For instance, Tang Sanzang epitomizes high universalism values, while Cao Cao represents a strong inclination towards power values. This selection process ensures a diverse and comprehensive array of roles, catering to a wide spectrum of values and facilitating a thorough evaluation of LLMs’ role-playing fidelity to assigned role values.

The RVD contains 19 value dimensions of PVQ-RR for each role and the stability of values within a given dimension.
